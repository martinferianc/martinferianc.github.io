 abstract = {Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to find the optimal neural network automatically for different scenarios. Among various NAS methods, the differentiable NAS (DNAS) approach has demonstrated its effectiveness in terms of searching cost and final accuracy. However, most of previous efforts focus on applying DNAS to GPU or CPU platforms, and its potential is less exploited on the FPGA. In this paper, we first propose a novel FPGA-based CNN accelerator. An accurate performance model of the proposed hardware design is also introduced. To improve accuracy as well as hardware performance, we then apply DNAS and encapsulate the proposed performance model into the objective function. Based on our FPGA design and NAS method, the experiments demonstrate that the network generated by NAS achieves nearly 95% accuracy on CIFAR-10, while decreasing latency by nearly 12 times compared with existing work.},
