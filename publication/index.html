      <p>Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated their potential in a variety of domains ranging from computer vision to natural language processing. Among various NNs, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted for a broad spectrum of applications such as image classification and video recognition, due to their excellent capabilities in extracting 2D and 3D features. However, standard 2D and 3D CNNs are not able to capture their model uncertainty which is crucial for many safety-critical applications including healthcare and autonomous driving. In contrast, Bayesian convolutional neural networks (BayesCNNs), as a variant of CNNs, have demonstrated their ability to express uncertainty in their prediction via a mathematical grounding. Nevertheless, BayesCNNs have not been widely used in industrial practice due to their compute requirements stemming from sampling and subsequent forward passes through the whole network multiple times. As a result, these requirements significantly increase the amount of computation and memory consumption in comparison to standard CNNs. This paper proposes a novel FPGA-based hardware architecture to accelerate both 2D and 3D BayesCNNs based on Monte Carlo Dropout. Compared with other state-of-the-art accelerators for BayesCNNs, the proposed design can achieve up to 4 times higher energy efficiency and 9 times better compute efficiency. An automatic framework capable of supporting partial Bayesian inference is proposed to explore the trade-off between algorithm and hardware performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our framework can effectively find the optimal implementations in the design space.</p>

      <p>Bayesian neural networks (BayesNNs) have demonstrated their advantages in various safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving or healthcare, due to their ability to capture and represent model uncertainty. However, standard BayesNNs require to be repeatedly run because of Monte Carlo sampling to quantify their uncertainty, which puts a burden on their real-world hardware performance. To address this performance issue, this paper systematically exploits the extensive structured sparsity and redundant computation in BayesNNs. Different from the unstructured or structured sparsity existing in standard convolutional NNs, the structured sparsity of BayesNNs is introduced by Monte Carlo Dropout and its associated sampling required during uncertainty estimation and prediction, which can be exploited through both algorithmic and hardware optimizations. We first classify the observed sparsity patterns into three categories: dropout sparsity, layer sparsity and sample sparsity. On the algorithmic side, a framework is proposed to automatically explore these three sparsity categories without sacrificing algorithmic performance. We demonstrated that structured sparsity can be exploited to accelerate CPU designs by up to 49 times, and GPU designs by up to 40 times. On the hardware side, a novel hardware architecture is proposed to accelerate BayesNNs, which achieves a high hardware performance using the runtime adaptable hardware engines and the intelligent skipping support. Upon implementing the proposed hardware design on an FPGA, our experiments demonstrated that the algorithm-optimized BayesNNs can achieve up to 56 times speedup when compared with unoptimized Bayesian nets. Comparing with the optimized GPU implementation, our FPGA design achieved up to 7.6 times speedup and up to 39.3 times higher energy efficiency</p>

      <p>Recent advances in algorithm-hardware co-design for deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their potential in automatically designing neural architectures and hardware designs. Nevertheless, it is still a challenging optimization problem due to the expensive training cost and the time-consuming hardware implementation, which makes the exploration on the vast design space of neural architecture and hardware design intractable. In this paper, we demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of locating designs on the Pareto frontier. This capability is enabled by a novel three-phase co-design framework, with the following new features: (a) decoupling DNN training from the design space exploration of hardware architecture and neural architecture, (b) providing a hardware-friendly neural architecture space by considering hardware characteristics in constructing the search cells, (c) adopting Gaussian process to predict accuracy, latency and power consumption to avoid time-consuming synthesis and place-and-route processes. In comparison with the manually-designed ResNet101, InceptionV2 and MobileNetV2, we can achieve up to 5% higher accuracy with up to <tex>$3times$</tex> speed up on the ImageNet dataset. Compared with other state-of-the-art co-design frameworks, our found network and hardware configuration can achieve 2% (~ 6% higher accuracy, <tex>$2times∼ 26times$</tex> smaller latency and <tex>$8.5times$</tex> higher energy efficiency.</p>

      <p>Neural networks have demonstrated their outstanding performance in a wide range of tasks. Specifically recurrent architectures based on long-short term memory (LSTM) cells have manifested excellent capability to model time dependencies in real-world data. However, standard recurrent architectures cannot estimate their uncertainty which is essential for safety-critical applications such as in medicine. In contrast, Bayesian recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are able to provide uncertainty estimation with improved accuracy. Nonetheless, Bayesian RNNs are computationally and memory demanding, which limits their practicality despite their advantages. To address this issue, we propose an FPGA-based hardware design to accelerate Bayesian LSTM-based RNNs. To further improve the overall algorithmic-hardware performance, a co-design framework is proposed to explore the most fitting algorithmic-hardware configurations for Bayesian RNNs. We conduct extensive experiments on healthcare applications to demonstrate the improvement of our design and the effectiveness of our framework. Compared with GPU implementation, our FPGA-based design can achieve up to 10 times speedup with nearly 106 times higher energy efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work targeting acceleration of Bayesian RNNs on FPGAs.</p>

      <p>Fully convolutional U-shaped neural networks have largely been the dominant approach for pixel-wise image segmentation. In this work, we tackle two defects that hinder their deployment in real-world applications 1) Predictions lack uncertainty quantification that may be crucial to many decision-making systems; 2) Large memory storage and computational consumption demanding extensive hardware resources. To address these issues and improve their practicality we demonstrate a few-parameter compact Bayesian convolutional architecture, that achieves a marginal improvement in accuracy in comparison to related work using significantly fewer parameters and compute operations. The architecture combines parameter-efficient operations such as separable convolutions, bilinear interpolation, multi-scale feature propagation and Bayesian inference for per-pixel uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo Dropout. The best performing configurations required fewer than 2.5 million parameters on diverse challenging datasets with few observations.</p>

      <p>Due to the huge success and rapid development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there is a growing demand for hardware accelerators that accommodate a variety of CNNs to improve their inference latency and energy efficiency, in order to enable their deployment in real-time applications. Among popular platforms, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been widely adopted for CNN acceleration because of their capability to provide superior energy efficiency and low-latency processing, while supporting high reconfigurability, making them favorable for accelerating rapidly evolving CNN algorithms. This article introduces a highly customized streaming hardware architecture that focuses on improving the compute efficiency for streaming applications by providing full-stack acceleration of CNNs on FPGAs. The proposed accelerator maps most computational functions, that is, convolutional and deconvolutional layers into a singular unified module, and implements the residual and concatenative connections between the functions with high efficiency, to support the inference of mainstream CNNs with different topologies. This architecture is further optimized through exploiting different levels of parallelism, layer fusion, and fully leveraging digital signal processing blocks (DSPs). The proposed accelerator has been implemented on Intel&rsquo;s Arria 10 GX1150 hardware and evaluated with a wide range of benchmark models. The results demonstrate a high performance of over 1.3 TOP/s of throughput, up to 97% of compute [multiply-accumulate (MAC)] efficiency, which outperforms the state-of-the-art FPGA accelerators.</p>

      <p>In recent years, neural architecture search (NAS) has received intensive scientific and industrial interest due to its capability of finding a neural architecture with high accuracy for various artificial intelligence tasks such as image classification or object detection. In particular, gradient-based NAS approaches have become one of the more popular approaches thanks to their computational efficiency during the search. However, these methods often experience a mode collapse, where the quality of the found architectures is poor due to the algorithm resorting to choosing a single operation type for the entire network, or stagnating at a local minima for various datasets or search spaces. To address these defects, we present a differentiable variational inference-based NAS method for searching sparse convolutional neural networks. Our approach finds the optimal neural architecture by dropping out candidate operations in an over-parameterised supergraph using variational dropout with automatic relevance determination prior, which makes the algorithm gradually remove unnecessary operations and connections without risking mode collapse. The evaluation is conducted through searching two types of convolutional cells that shape the neural network for classifying different image datasets. Our method finds diverse network cells, while showing state-of-the-art accuracy with up to almost 2 times fewer non-zero parameters.</p>

Increase in resource consumption results in NNs&rsquo; reduced adoption rate and real-world deployment impracticality. Therefore, NNs need to be compressed to make them available to a wider audience and at the same time decrease their runtime costs. In this work, we approach this challenge from a causal inference perspective, and we propose a scoring mechanism to facilitate structured pruning of NNs. The approach is based on measuring mutual information under a maximum entropy perturbation, sequentially propagated through the NN. We demonstrate the method&rsquo;s performance on two datasets and various NNs&rsquo; sizes, and we show that our approach achieves competitive performance under challenging conditions.</p>

      <p>Contemporary advances in neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated their potential in different applications such as in image classification, object detection or natural language processing. In particular, reconfigurable accelerators have been widely used for the acceleration of NNs due to their reconfigurability and efficiency in specific application instances. To determine the configuration of the accelerator, it is necessary to conduct design space exploration to optimize the performance. However, the process of design space exploration is time consuming because of the slow performance evaluation for different configurations. Therefore, there is a demand for an accurate and fast performance prediction method to speed up design space exploration. This work introduces a novel method for fast and accurate estimation of different metrics that are of importance when performing design space exploration. The method is based on a Gaussian process regression model parametrised by the features of the accelerator and the target NN to be accelerated. We evaluate the proposed method together with other popular machine learning based methods in estimating the latency and energy consumption of our implemented accelerator on two different hardware platforms targeting convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate improvements in estimation accuracy, without the need for significant implementation effort or tuning.</p>

      <p>Fully convolutional U-shaped neural networks have largely been the dominant approach for pixel-wise image segmentation. In this work, we tackle two defects that hinder their deployment in real-world applications: 1) Predictions lack uncertainty quantification that may be crucial to many decision-making systems; 2) Large memory storage and computational consumption demanding extensive hardware resources. To address these issues and improve their practicality we demonstrate a few-parameter compact Bayesian convolutional architecture, that achieves a marginal improvement in accuracy in comparison to related work using significantly fewer parameters and compute operations. The architecture combines parameter-efficient operations such as separable convolutions, bilinear interpolation, multi-scale feature propagation and Bayesian inference for per-pixel uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo Dropout. The best performing configurations required fewer than 2.5 million parameters on diverse challenging datasets with few observations.</p>

      <p>Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to find the optimal neural network automatically for different scenarios. Among various NAS methods, the differentiable NAS (DNAS) approach has demonstrated its effectiveness in terms of searching cost and final accuracy. However, most of previous efforts focus on applying DNAS to GPU or CPU platforms, and its potential is less exploited on the FPGA. In this paper, we first propose a novel FPGA-based CNN accelerator. An accurate performance model of the proposed hardware design is also introduced. To improve accuracy as well as hardware performance, we then apply DNAS and encapsulate the proposed performance model into the objective function. Based on our FPGA design and NAS method, the experiments demonstrate that the network generated by NAS achieves nearly 95% accuracy on CIFAR-10, while decreasing latency by nearly 12 times compared with existing work.</p>

      <p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied in various computer vision and speech processing applications. However, the algorithmic complexity of CNNs hinders their deployment in embedded systems with limited memory and computational resources. This paper proposes static block floating-point (BFP) quantization, an effective approach involving Kullback-Leibler divergence, to determine the static shared exponents. Without need for retraining, the proposed approach is able to quantize CNNs to 8 bits with negligible accuracy loss. An FPGA-based hardware design with static BFP quantization is also proposed. Compared with 8-bit integer linear quantization, our experiments show that the hardware kernel based on static BFP quantization can achieve over 50% reduction in logic resources on an FPGA. Based on static BFP quantization, a tool implemented in the PyTorch framework is developed, which can automatically generate optimised configuration according to user requirements for given CNN models, where the entire optimization process takes only a few minutes on an Intel Xeon Silver 4110 CPU.</p>

      <p>Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) have demonstrated their outstanding classification accuracy for human action recognition (HAR). However, the large number of computations and parameters in 3D CNNs limits their deployability in real-life applications. To address this challenge, this paper adopts an algorithm-hardware co-design method by proposing an efficient 3D CNN building unit called 3D-1 bottleneck residual block (3D-1 BRB) at the algorithm level, and a corresponding FPGA-based hardware architecture called F-E3D at the hardware level. Based on 3D-1 BRB, a novel 3D CNN model called E3DNet is developed, which achieves nearly 37 times reduction in model size and 5% improvement in accuracy compared to standard 3D CNNs on the UCF101 dataset. Together with several hardware optimizations, including 3D fused BRB, online blocking and kernel reuse, the proposed F-E3D is nearly 13 times faster than a previous FPGA design for 3D CNNs, with performance and accuracy comparable to other state-of-the-art 3D CNN models on GPU platforms while requiring only 7% of their energy consumption.</p>

  <a href="/publication/fan-2018-real/"  class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection has been widely employed in various applications such as autonomous driving and intelligent video surveillance. However, the computational complexity of conventional convolution hinders its application in embedded systems. Recently, a mobile-friendly CNN model SSDLite-MobileNetV2 (SSDLiteM2) has been proposed for object detection. This model consists of a novel layer called bottleneck residual block (BRB). Although SSDLiteM2 contains far fewer parameters and computations than conventional CNN models, its performance on embedded devices still cannot meet the requirements of real-time processing. This paper proposes a novel FPGA-based architecture for SSDLiteM2 in combination with hardware optimizations including fused BRB, processing element (PE) sharing and load-balanced channel pruning. Moreover, a novel quantization scheme called partial quantization has been developed, which partially quantizes SSDLiteM2 to 8 bits with only 1.8% accuracy loss. Experiments show that the proposed design on a Xilinx ZC706 device can achieve up to 65 frames per second with 20.3 mean average precision on the COCO dataset.</p>
