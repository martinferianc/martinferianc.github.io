However, standard BayesNNs require to be repeatedly run because of Monte Carlo sampling to quantify their uncertainty, which puts a burden on their real-world hardware performance. To address this performance issue, this paper systematically exploits the extensive structured sparsity and redundant computation in BayesNNs. Different from the unstructured or structured sparsity existing in standard convolutional NNs, the structured sparsity of BayesNNs is introduced by Monte Carlo Dropout and its associated sampling required during uncertainty estimation and prediction, which can be exploited through both algorithmic and hardware optimizations. We first classify the observed sparsity patterns into three categories: dropout sparsity, layer sparsity and sample sparsity. On the algorithmic side, a framework is proposed to automatically explore these three sparsity categories without sacrificing algorithmic performance. We demonstrated that structured sparsity can be exploited to accelerate CPU designs by up to 49 times, and GPU designs by up to 40 times. On the hardware side, a novel hardware architecture is proposed to accelerate BayesNNs, which achieves a high hardware performance using the runtime adaptable hardware engines and the intelligent skipping support. Upon implementing the proposed hardware design on an FPGA, our experiments demonstrated that the algorithm-optimized BayesNNs can achieve up to 56 times speedup when compared with unoptimized Bayesian nets.

Studies have shown that NHL players experience an average of 1.8 concussions every 1000 hours of play and almost double that for juniors, with 12% reporting a head injury. Of these injuries sustained, over half may go unreported, demonstrating that concussions are a regular occurrence across all leagues.\nWorking with Owen Harcombe, Alexander T. Luisi and Alexander Montgomerie-Corcoran, we developed a prototype Internet of Things product, that sits inside a player’s helmet to detect and track impacts while they are on the ice. The embedded device incorporates a gyro and accelerometer to measure these forces, and uses a WiFi enabled microcontroller to report the data back to a central server. The data is then processed and delivered to the user via an intuitive web application, making it accessible across mobile and desktop. We employed machine learning to better interpret the sensor data, and I added a unique touch by using a K-means algorithm to filter the impacts reported by the sensors, alleviating the need for long sensor calibration.\nAnother part of the coursework was to develop a marketing and business strategy for the prototype product. Having always been on the engineering side of product development, this was an entirely new experience, and one that I found very rewarding, as well as a skill that I would like to develop further.

This virtual CPU was built in tandem with an automatic verification platform designed to exercise its capabilities. The deliverable had emphasis on rigorous memory management, data format encoding, including endianness as well as simulating exceptions and branch handling. The CPU and the verification platform followed a strictly defined Application Programming Interface (API) to make them portable and sustainable for potential future uses. It also enabled for my colleagues and me to test our work against each other’s frameworks, to ensure that our solutions were as rigorous as possible.\nReflecting on this coursework, it was a tremendously useful exercise that taught me in greater detail about memory management in C++ and improved my general programming skills. It also solidified my understanding of basic processor architectures, particularly Reduced Instruction Set Architectures. You can try my work for yourself at: Link.\nLater in the course, I developed a compiler that took C89 code and compiled it down to the MIPS1 Instruction set. The output of this compiler would also be simulated using QEMU but could be ported to the CPU simulator.

But, let’s be honest, in a hyper-connected world dominated by notifications, work and family life, how good are we actually at keeping track of how much water we’ve had to drink during the day? It’s a natural reflex to drink water only when thirsty, but this is not enough. In fact, doctors have shown that forgetting to stay hydrated during the day can result in reduced concentration, dizziness and fatigue, with more serious consequences of dehydration following.\nRecognizing these symptoms ourselves during busy days in College, a few of my friends and I began Wells. We developed the wellsCap, a ‘smart cap’ that would fit on a regular PET bottle, transforming it into a smart device that measures daily water intake. It securely synchronizes with an application that records and subsequently determines the ideal daily water intake based on a number of personal factors, tailoring intake specifically to an individual.\nI constructed a unique, thermoelectric heat pump that was able to recycle the energy in the warm air escaping from a building into fresh air being drawn in. The device consisted of passive and active components, controlled by an embedded system built upon the Arduino platform. I also developed the connectivity aspects and successfully deployed the system.\nMy role in the team was as the hardware engineer, responsible for product prototyping and the measurement system. I was also in charge of driving the team forward, driving our idea forward from beyond just paper. We were recognized for our efforts, coming first place at the CISCO Switch-Up Challenge in London in 2016. After a series of individual projects during high school, this experience taught me how to work in a mixed discipline team, in order to achieve the best results.\n","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"8e31dc0441ff6a62749f9b71941101e3","permalink":"https://martinferianc.github.io/project/project_2/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project_2/","section":"project","summary":"Embedded Systems, Healthcare, Python, Machine Learning.","tags":["Embedded Systems","Healthcare","Machine Learning","Sensoring"],"title":"wells","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Západoslovenská Distribučná a.s. (ZSD) is the major electricity distribution company in the western part of Slovakia. More than one million households depend on ZSD for their electricity, and so to ensure that everyone stays connected to the grid, ZSD collects data by means of Smart Meters, deployed throughout western Slovakia. Data collection is nothing without data analytics and processing, and this needs to be done for each and every customer.\nThese smart meters lacked support in the ZSD’s software stack, meaning that swathes of customer data had to be stored and processed manually, costing time and money. Upon my entry to the company as an intern, I was tasked to develop a software toolbox in Java to process and format this data so that it could be imported into an existing database.\nThe project was a success, and is still relied upon today- a great achievement considering that this was my first internship in a corporate environment. I learned a great deal about how to interact with other software developers and the platform’s target user base, as well as how a department functions within the wider company.
